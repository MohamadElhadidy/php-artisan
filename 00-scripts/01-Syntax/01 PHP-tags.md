# Escaping From HTML

 1. Everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser which allows PHP files to have mixed content. This allows PHP to be embedded in HTML documents.
	  - Example #1 Embedding PHP in HTML

		    `<p>This is going to be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.</p>
		    <?php echo 'While this is going to be parsed.'; ?>
		    <p>This will also be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.</p>`

 2. You can have HTML tags with optional attributes, depending on some PHP condition. Extremely flexible and useful!

		<p<?php  if  ($highlight):  ?> class="highlight"<?php endif;?>>This is a paragraph.</p>

 3. Using structures with conditions, the PHP interpreter will jump over blocks contained within a condition that is not met.
	  - Example #2 Advanced escaping using conditions

	   `<?php if ($expression == true): ?>
	    This will show if the expression is true.
	    <?php else: ?>  
	    Otherwise this will show.
	    <?php endif; ?>`


     `<?php for ($i = 0; $i < 5; ++$i): ?>
    	   Hello, there!
    	<?php endfor; ?>`


 4. For outputting large blocks of text, dropping out of PHP parsing mode is generally more efficient than sending all of the text through echo or print,  this means that when you're writing a lot of HTML or plain text, it's better to close the PHP tag (?>) and just write the text normally instead of outputting everything with echo or print.

5. Never use ?> inside a // comment â€” it will end PHP execution!, Use /* */ comments instead when the line contains ?>, Or break the string into parts to avoid writing ?> directly, PHP ignores the // comment when it sees ?>, and drops out of PHP mode, treating everything after ?> as HTML output.

	   `<?php
	    // $file_contents = '<?php die(); ?>' . "\n";
	    ?>' . "\n";`

 -The fix
   ` <?php
    /* $file_contents = '<?php die(); ?>' . "\n"; */
    $file_contents = '<' . '?php die(); ?' . '>' . "\n";`
