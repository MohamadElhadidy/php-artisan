# 01 - Basic Calculator

This is a beginner-level PHP project that implements a simple web-based calculator. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations — **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** — using a simple HTML form and server-side PHP logic.

## 📌 Features

- Input two numbers
- Choose an arithmetic operation: `+`, `−`, `×`, `/`
- Displays the calculated result after form submission
- Basic validation (e.g., divide-by-zero protection)
- Clean and minimal UI for ease of use

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the form
- **CSS** – for basic styling 
- **PHP** – for handling form submission and performing calculations
